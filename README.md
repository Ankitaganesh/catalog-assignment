Polynomial Secret Finder

This Java application solves for the constant term (secret) of an unknown polynomial given a set of points in a specific encoded format.
Problem Description
The application finds the constant term of an unknown polynomial where:

The polynomial degree m is determined by k = m + 1

Points are provided in a special encoded format with different number bases

A minimum of k points are required to solve for the coefficients

Polynomial Form
f(x) = a_m x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + ... + a_1 x + c
where:

f(x) is the polynomial function
m is the degree of the polynomial
a_m, a_{m-1}, ..., a_1, c are coefficients (positive integers)
a_m â‰  0
c is the secret we need to find
